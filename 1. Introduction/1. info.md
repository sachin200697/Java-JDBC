## To download Mysql: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
Download second one.
Set path for mysql: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5920136/mysql-is-not-recognised-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-program-or-b


validation for mysql: cmd> mysql -u root -p          //provide password for root

## To install jdbc driver for mysql to connect mysql with java: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
Choose platform independent and download second one. 
Set the classpath of jar:
copy jar file from the downloaded driver zip file -> create a new folder inside C:->program files folder->crate a new folder "JavaDrivers" -> paste jar file in it -> copy path of this jar file with file name:
C:\Program Files\JavaDrivers\mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar
then create a new variable inside environment variables: classpath: C:\Program Files\JavaDrivers\mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar

Validate: in cmd > javap com.mysql.jdbc.Driver  //it shold show the code of mysql Driver class


## Connectivity Steps: 
----------------------

1. Load the driver:

Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"); 
OR
DriverManager.registerDriver(new com.mysql.jdbc.Driver());

Note: //for higher version we need to use: com.mysql..cj.jdbc.Driver

2. Create a connection:

import java.sql.*;

Connection = con = DriverManager.getConnection("url", "username", "password");

url(for mysql) : jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dbname              
//here 3306 is the port no on which mysql is running and for localhost we can also use 127.0.0.1
// check port for mysql -> in cmd open mysql then type \s
//dbname: schema or database name in which tables are present 

username : root or any user that you created for mysql
password : password for user like for root give the password that you set

3. Create query: 

types: 
    Statement: For normal queries
    PreparedStatement: for dynamic queries like if we want to use java variables in query
    CallableStatement: for trigger and function calling and procedure calling

Ex:     String q = "Select * from user";
        Statement stmt = con.createStatement(); //con is from step 2
        ResultSet set = stmt.executeQuery(q); //if we expect some data from mysql table
        or stmt.executeUpdate(q);   //if we want to do any change to database; //it returns a int value

4. Process the data:
    while(set.next()){
        int id = set.getInt("StudentID");   //we can use column_name or also can use the no of column like if id is first column than 
        //pass 1 or if name is third column then pass 3

        String name = set.getString("StudentName");
    }        

5. Close the connection:
    con.close();

6. Note: Program will show the output only if we run it using command line:
    #> javac Program_name.java
    #> java Program_name
